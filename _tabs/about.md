Hi I'm vxcall, I am a

#### web engineer

I have been working as a web engineer in Tokyo since 2021. In my job, both back-end and front-end development is my field of expertise, as well as coordinating and extending docker and CI/CD. Mainly coding Ruby now but since I love statically typed language better, I'd love to write Go or Rust.

#### reverse engineer

The interest in reverse engineering has reared its head in me since 2020 as one of my hobbies, my first ever output was [Dainsleif](https://github.com/vxcall/Dainsleif), an open source cheat software for game called CS:GO. However I'm not particularly interestetd in game hack, cuz i hate cheaters, but rather in interrogating and making software behave in whatever way I like. Since then, I've been enjoying things such as studying reverse engineering with IDA, tried cheat development in Rustlang, studied kernel driver development in earnest whenever I felt like it. I'm still halfway through all of these, but enjoying it as a casual hobby.

## About this blog

I'm planning to write articles on my development and experience in the context of reverse engineering. It will be treated as a kind of small handy note for myself, but I hope it will be of use to someone else in case it is of interest.

Here's a list of topics you might encounter in this blog:

```
Reverse engineering
Deobfuscation and devirtualization
Windows kernel mode development
Hypervisor development
Web development
```
{: file='Things I find attractive'}

Some of these are subjects I'm actively diving into, while others are still on my to-do list.

Please be informed that I have no intention of selling game cheats or tools. I'm just a FOSS enthusiast so.
